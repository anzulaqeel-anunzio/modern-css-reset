# Modern CSS Reset

A highly opinionated, modern CSS reset that improves upon traditional normalizers by using better defaults for modern web development.

## Features

-   **Box Sizing**: `border-box` everywhere.
-   **Image Defaults**: Images are block-level and responsive by default.
-   **Typography**: Fluid body line-height and sensible font inheritance.
-   **Reduced Motion**: Respects user preference.

## Installation

1.  **Clone the repository** OR copy the CSS.
2.  **HTML Usage**:
    ```html
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/reset.css">
    ```

## Usage

Just link the file at the top of your `<head>` before any other styles.
